    <h3>History</h3>
   <pre><em> Jamia Binoria was founded by Mufti Muhammed Naeem in 1978 (Rajab 1398 AH).[4][5] It is affiliated <br/> to Ittehad Tanzeematul Madaris-e-Deeniya (ITMD), a confederacy of five religious education boards.<br/>[6] At one time, Jamiah Binoria is said to have had the highest enrollment of foreign students in<br/> Pakistan. The international enrollment dropped following the September 11, 2001 <br/>.[7] In 2005, it had around 3,000 male and 500 female students, including students from United <br/>States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany and East Asia.[7] Jamia Binoria also has ifta<br/> courses for women, thereafter calling them "muftia" (female Muftis).[8
    
    On 23 June 2020, Noman Naeem was appointed as the chancellor (or Principal) of the seminary<br/> following the death of his father Mufti Muhammad Naeem on 20 June 2020.[9]</em></pre>
